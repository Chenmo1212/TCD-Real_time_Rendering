Hi, everyone.

This is my video submission for real-time rendering assignment one 

and this task was to compare three reflectance models, 

one had to be a Phong or Blinn-Phong, so i've gone with Phong, 

and the other two are non-realistic and realistic shader methods.

The first one is the toon shading.
Toon shading is a simplified shading model for creating a toon-like look to 3D models.

It is a non-photorealistic technique, and it doesn't take into account any physical properties of the surface or lighting, but rather creates a flat-shaded appearance with an outline around it.

The middle one is phong shading. 
Phong shading is an early shading model that uses a combination of ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting to approximate the appearance of a surface.

Cook-Torrance shading is a more advanced shading model that takes into account more physical properties of the light-surface interaction. It uses multiple components, including a diffuse response, a specular response, a shadowing response, and a Fresnel response, to calculate a more realistic-looking surface. 

I also made some shortkeys to control the different features, like if u press W or S key, the strength of three models will be changed. And if u press M key, teapots will start spinning. The last one is L key, which allows the lighting source to rotate around the teapot so we can see the reflection easily. 

Finally, I also used the diffuse reflection and specular reflection of toon shading to make a comparison of different parameters. It shows if the same model is applied different parameters, it will also lead to different reflection effects.

Yeah, that's all my submission, thank you for watching.
